# Code Quality Workflow
#
# This reusable workflow executes code quality checks using prek (prek workspace tool)
# with support for monorepo configurations and multiple prek configs.
#
# Key Features:
# - Workspace mode support (multiple .pre-commit-config.yaml files)
# - Multi-language support (Python, Node.js, etc.)
# - Automatic environment management
# - Dependency caching
# - Parallel check execution
#
# Process Stages:
# 1. Checkout:
#    - Full repository history
#    - LFS file support
#
# 2. Quality Checks (via prek):
#    - Code linting
#    - Style verification
#    - Type checking
#    - Best practices validation
#    - Runs appropriate hooks based on file location
#
# 3. Results Processing:
#    - Error reporting
#    - Check summaries
#    - Status updates
#
# Required Inputs:
# - python-version: Python version for checks (default: "3.10")
#
# Example Usage:
# 1. Default Configuration:
#    jobs:
#      quality:
#        uses: ./.github/workflows/_reusable-code-quality.yaml
#
# 2. Custom Versions:
#    jobs:
#      quality:
#        uses: ./.github/workflows/_reusable-code-quality.yaml
#        with:
#          python-version: "3.11"
#
# Note: Uses prek-action (https://github.com/j178/prek-action) which supports
# multiple pre-commit configs in workspace mode for monorepo setups
