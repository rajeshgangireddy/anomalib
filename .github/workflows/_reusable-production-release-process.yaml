# Production Release Process Workflow
#
# This reusable workflow manages the production release process, including
# validation, preparation, and publication steps.
#
# Key Features:
# - Release readiness validation
# - RC approval verification
# - Production deployment
# - Artifact management
# - Release publication
#
# Process Stages:
# 1. Release Validation:
#    - RC approval verification
#    - Version compatibility check
#    - Release readiness assessment
#
# 2. Release Preparation:
#    - Artifact collection
#    - Production bundle creation
#    - Documentation updates
#
# 3. Publication:
#    - Production PyPI deployment
#    - GitHub release creation
#    - Documentation publishing
#
# Required Inputs:
# - version: Release version
# - artifact-name: Name of validated artifact
#
# Note: PyPI publishing uses OIDC (OpenID Connect) authentication.
# Configure trusted publisher in PyPI project settings:
# - Owner: <your-org>
# - Repository name: anomalib
# - Workflow name: release.yaml
# - Environment name: production
#
# Example Usage:
# 1. Production Release:
#    jobs:
#      release:
#        uses: ./.github/workflows/_reusable-production-release-process.yaml
#        with:
#          version: "v1.2.3"
#          artifact-name: "dist-123456789"
#        secrets:
#          pypi-token: ${{ secrets.PYPI_TOKEN }}
#
# Note: Should only be triggered after successful RC process completion
