"""Model loader callback.

This module provides the :class:`LoadModelCallback` for loading pre-trained model weights from a state dict.

The callback loads model weights from a specified path when inference begins. This is useful for loading
pre-trained models for inference or fine-tuning.

Example:
    Load pre-trained weights and create a trainer:

    >>> from anomalib.callbacks import LoadModelCallback
    >>> from anomalib.engine import Engine
    >>> from anomalib.models import Padim
    >>> model = Padim()
    >>> callbacks = [LoadModelCallback(weights_path="path/to/weights.pt")]
    >>> engine = Engine(model=model, callbacks=callbacks)

Note:
    The weights file should be a PyTorch state dict saved with either a ``.pt`` or ``.pth`` extension.
    The state dict should contain a ``"state_dict"`` key with the model weights.

    """Callback that loads model weights from a state dict.

    This callback loads pre-trained model weights from a specified path when inference begins.
    The weights are loaded into the model's state dict using the device specified by the model.

    Args:
        weights_path (str): Path to the model weights file (``.pt`` or ``.pth``).
            The file should contain a state dict with a ``"state_dict"`` key.

    Examples:
        Create a callback and use it with a trainer:

        >>> from anomalib.callbacks import LoadModelCallback
        >>> from anomalib.engine import Engine
        >>> from anomalib.models import Padim

    Note:
