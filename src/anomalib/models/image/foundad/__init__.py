"""FoundAD: Foundation Visual Encoders Are Secretly Few-Shot Anomaly Detectors.

FoundAD trains a lightweight manifold projector on a frozen DINOv2 encoder with
CutPaste augmentation for off-manifold supervision. Anomaly detection is performed
by measuring the MSE between encoder features and projector output.

Example:
    >>> from anomalib.models.image import FoundAD
    >>> model = FoundAD()
