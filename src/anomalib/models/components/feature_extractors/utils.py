"""Utility functions to manipulate feature extractors.

This module provides utility functions for working with feature extractors,
including functions to analyze feature map dimensions.

Example:
    >>> import torch
    >>> from anomalib.models.components.feature_extractors import (
    ...     TimmFeatureExtractor,
    ...     dryrun_find_featuremap_dims
    ... )
    >>> # Create feature extractor
    >>> extractor = TimmFeatureExtractor(
    ...     backbone="resnet18",
    ...     layers=["layer1", "layer2"]
    ... )
    >>> # Get feature dimensions
    >>> dims = dryrun_find_featuremap_dims(
    ...     extractor,
    ...     input_size=(256, 256),
    ...     layers=["layer1", "layer2"]
    ... )
    >>> print(dims["layer1"]["num_features"])  # Number of channels
    64
    >>> print(dims["layer1"]["resolution"])  # Feature map height, width
    (64, 64)
"""

    """Get feature map dimensions by running an empty tensor through the model.

    Performs a forward pass with an empty tensor to determine the output
    dimensions of specified feature maps.

    Args:
        feature_extractor: Feature extraction model, either a ``TimmFeatureExtractor``
            or ``GraphModule``.
        input_size: Tuple of ``(height, width)`` specifying input image dimensions.
        layers: List of layer names from which to extract features.

    Returns:
        Dictionary mapping layer names to dimension information. For each layer,
        returns a dictionary with:
            - ``num_features``: Number of feature channels (int)
            - ``resolution``: Spatial dimensions as ``(height, width)`` tuple

    Example:
        >>> extractor = TimmFeatureExtractor("resnet18", layers=["layer1"])
        >>> dims = dryrun_find_featuremap_dims(
        ...     extractor,

        ...     layers=["layer1"]
        ... )
        >>> print(dims["layer1"]["num_features"])  # channels
        64
        >>> print(dims["layer1"]["resolution"])  # (height, width)
