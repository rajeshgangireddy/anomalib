"""Utility Functions for the Tiled Ensemble Pipeline.

This module provides auxiliary functions and classes that support the core
components of the Tiled Ensemble approach.

Included Utilities:
    - `ensemble_engine`: Modified Anomalib Engine, adjusted to support ensemble training.
    - `ensemble_tiling`: Functions to divide images into tiles and manage their positions.
    - `helper_functions`: Miscellaneous helper functions used across the pipeline.
    - `prediction_data`: Data structure to store and manage predictions.
    - `prediction_merging`: Functions to merge predictions from different tiles.
