    """Class used for merging the data predicted by each separate model of tiled ensemble.

    Tiles are stacked in one tensor and untiled using Ensemble Tiler.
    Boxes from tiles are either stacked or generated anew from anomaly map.
    Labels are combined with OR operator, meaning one anomalous tile -> anomalous image.
    Scores are averaged across all tiles.
