"""Core Components for the Tiled Ensemble Pipeline.

This module aggregates the essential components utilized in the Tiled Ensemble.
Each component is designed to handle specific stages of the pipeline.

Included Components:
    - `merging`: Job to merge predictions from individual tiles into a whole output.
    - `metrics_calculation`: Job to compute evaluation metrics at image levels.
    - `model_training`: Job for training models on individual tiles.
    - `normalization`: Job to normalize predictions.
    - `prediction`: Job to generate predictions for each tile.
    - `smoothing`: Job to smooth seams between tiles for seamless reconstruction.
    - `stats_calculation`: Job to compute statistics required by normalisation and thresholding.
    - `thresholding`: Job to apply thresholds to predictions.
    - `visualization`: Job to visualize predictions and anomalies.
