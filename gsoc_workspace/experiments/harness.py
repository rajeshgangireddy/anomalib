"""Core harness for the synthetic-anomaly experiments.

A single job trains one model **once** on all train normals and then derives every
evaluation arm from that identical model, so the arms differ only in the threshold
source (never in the underlying weights). This removes the model-variance confound
that separate per-arm training introduced.

Arms (all share one trained model; full official test for A and B):
    A: oracle. Threshold from the real test (fit-time val = SAME_AS_TEST) -> oracle F1-max.
    B: proxy. Threshold refit on {real test normals + N synthetic anomalies}
       (N = real anomaly count), then transferred to the full real test. Differs from
       A only in real->synthetic anomalies (same normals, same model).
    C: diagnostic. Threshold refit on, and evaluated on, the synthetic set itself
       (is the synthetic set too easy/hard relative to the real test?).
